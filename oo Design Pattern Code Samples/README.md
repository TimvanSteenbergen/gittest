Design Patterns learned so far:
- Observer;
- Proxy - Provide a surrogate or a placeholder for another object to get access to it;
- Iterator; (for instance the foreach-command)
- Chain of Responsibility - Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more then one object the chance to process the request; (for instance
- Facade - Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem; (also for instance the foreach-command)
- Factory - Define an interface for creating an interface, but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate;
- Decorator - Attach additional responsibility to an object dynamically;
- Adapter - Convert the interface of a class to another interface that the client expects;
