Terms checked out so far:
- Function overloading or method overloading is a feature found in various programming languages
such as Ada, C++, C#, Delphi, D, Java, and Swift, that allows creating several methods with the
same name which differ from each other in the type of the input and the output of the function.
 It is simply defined as the ability of one function to perform different tasks.

- Polymorphisme:
In programming languages and type theory, polymorphism (from Greek πολύς, polys, "many, much" and
  "form, shape") is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types.[1] A polymorphic type is a type
  whose operations can also be applied to values of some other type, or types.[2] There are several fundamentally
  different kinds of polymorphism:
* If a function denotes different and potentially heterogeneous implementations depending on a limited range of
  individually specified types and combinations, it is called ad hoc polymorphism. Ad hoc polymorphism is supported in
  many languages using function overloading.
* If the code is written without mention of any specific type and thus can be used transparently with any number of new
  types, it is called parametric polymorphism. In the object-oriented programming community, this is often known as
  generics or generic programming. In the functional programming community, this is often simply called polymorphism.
* Subtyping (or inclusion polymorphism) is a concept wherein a name may denote instances of many different classes as
  long as they are related by some common superclass.[3] In object-oriented programming, this is often referred to simply
  as polymorphism.

WCF:
Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) is a framework for building service-oriented applications.
